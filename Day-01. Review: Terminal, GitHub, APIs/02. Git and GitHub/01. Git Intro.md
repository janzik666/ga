# Intro to git

_After this lesson, you will be able to:_

- Explain basic git commands like init, add, commit, push, pull, and clone
- Distinguish between local and remote repositories
- Create, copy, and delete repositories locally or on GitHub
- Fork and clone remote repositories

#### What is Git?

[Git](https://git-scm.com/) is:

- A program you run from the command line
- A distributed version control system

Programmers use Git to keep a history of all their code changes. This means that they can rollback changes (or switch to older versions) as far back as when they started using Git on their project.

Do you know how Google Docs allows you to have a "version history" and move between different versions whenever you want? Git enables you to do that with any folder—and its contents—on your computer!

A codebase in Git is called a **repository**, or **repo**, for short.

**_Knowledge Check_** Who invented Git?

Git was created by [Linus Torvalds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_Torvalds), the principal developer of Linux.

## Guided Practice: Let's use Git! (15 mins)

Let's make our first Git repo. Try this with me!

First, create a directory on your Desktop:

```sh
cd ~/Desktop
mkdir hello-world
cd hello-world
```

You can place this directory under Git revision control using the command:

```sh
git init
```

Git will reply:

```txt
Initialized empty Git repository in <location>
```

> Check: Did you get this message?

You've now initialized the working directory.

#### The .git folder

If we look at the contents of this empty folder using:

```sh
ls -a
```

We should see that there is now a hidden folder called `.git`; this is where all the information about your repository is stored. You do not need to make any changes to this folder. You can control all the Git flow using `git` commands. (If you ever want to delete all Git repo information and history, you can delete the `.git` folder.)

#### Add a file

Let's create a new file:

```sh
touch a.txt
```

If we run `git status`, we should get:

```bash
On branch master

Initial commit

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)

	a.txt

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
```

This means that there is a new **untracked** file. Untracked means that Git is ignoring it.

Next, tell Git to take a snapshot of the contents of *all* files under the current directory (note the `.` at the end of the command)

```sh
git add .
```

This snapshot is now stored in a temporary staging area, which Git calls the **index**". We can view the index by typing:

```git status```

You should see this:

```
On branch master

No commits yet

Changes to be committed:
  (use "git rm --cached <file>..." to unstage)
        new file:   a.txt
```

#### Commit

To permanently store or **commit** the contents of the index in the repository, you need to run:

```sh
git commit -m "Initial commit"
```

The text after the `-m` is a commit message that should describe what has changed since the last commit. In our case, this is the first commit, so we just put "Initial commit."

You should now see something like :

```sh
[master (root-commit) cd48677] Initial commit
 1 file changed, 0 insertions(+), 0 deletions(-)
 create mode 100644 a.txt
```

> Check: Did you get this message? Note: If Git has not been configured with a name and email address, you may receive a warning here.

#### Checking the log

If we want to view the commit history, we can run:

```sh
git log
```

You should see a commit ID, author, date, and commit message similar to the following:

```bash
commit cd4867794cec942df7841a0f17564f9861bb6842 (HEAD -> master)
Author: Ben <ben.piper@generalassemb.ly>
Date:   Mon Feb 5 15:20:07 2024 -0500

    Initial commit
```

> Check: Did you get this message?

#### Make changes to the file

Now let's open `a.txt` in a text editor.

Inside the file, write something and save the file.

Back in the terminal, type

```sh
git status
```

You'll see that the file `a.txt` has been modified. To see exactly how it has changed since the last commit, type

```
git diff
```

You will see the text that you added to the file.

Go ahead and add this file to the index and commit it.

```sh
git add .
git commit -m "update file"
```

#### Revert to a previous commit

Checking `git log` will show you 2 commits with different ids:

```bash
commit 34309687fc4bc9ae382225849700edfc54621c9b (HEAD -> master)
Author: Ben <ben.piper@generalassemb.ly>
Date:   Mon Feb 5 15:36:13 2024 -0500

    update file

commit cd4867794cec942df7841a0f17564f9861bb6842
Author: Ben <ben.piper@generalassemb.ly>
Date:   Mon Feb 5 15:20:07 2024 -0500

    Initial commit
```

We can revert the file to the first commit using the first part of the specific commit ID we want to revert:

```bash
git revert 3430
```

This will undo the last commit. You can see this with a `git log`.

#### What is GitHub?

[GitHub](https://github.com/) is:

- A hosting service for Git repositories
- A web interface to explore Git repositories
- A social network of programmers
  - We all have individual accounts and put our codebases on our GitHub account
  - You can follow users and star your favorite projects
- A place where developers can access public codebases

#### Can you use Git without GitHub?

> Instructor Note: Explain the differences between 'remote' and 'local'.

Git is a software program that enables version control on local folders on your machine. Git*Hub* is a place to host your Git repositories remotely.

Read [this](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11816424/understanding-the-basics-of-git-and-github) when you have time!

> Check: Describe how remote files compare to local files. Describe how Git compares to GitHub.

## Why is Git tricky to understand? (15 mins)

Git is tricky to understand because describing 'how' it works would require the use of strange and technical-sounding words like:

- [Directed acyclic graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph)
- [SHA-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-1)
- blob
- tree

However, you don't need to know how it works under the hood to use it.

#### Trees?!

Even though you don't need to know how they work, it is useful to know that your local repository consists of three "trees" maintained by Git.

- **Working Directory**: Like any other folder on your machine; just holds the actual files
- **Index**: Acts as a staging area (an area that holds files "ready" to be versioned)
- **HEAD**: Points to the last commit you've made (the last "version" of the code you've stored using git)

#### So many commands?!

There are also a lot of commands you can use in Git. You can take a look at a list of the available commands by running:

```bash
git help -a
```

Even though there are many commands in the course, we will only need about 10.

#### Git File Lifecycle

To understand how Git works, we need to talk about the lifecycle of a Git-tracked file.

![lifecycle](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/40461/8226866/62730b4c-159a-11e5-89cd-20b72ed1de45.png)

Schema From [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Recording-Changes-to-the-Repository)

There are four main stages of Git version-controlled file:

1. **Untracked**: When a file is "untracked," Git is not "watching" this file; the file will not be added in the next commit
2. **Staged**: Staged files have not yet been committed to memory, but they are "on deck," so to speak, for your next commit
3. **Unmodified**: The file has already been committed and has not changed since the last commit
4. **Modified**: You have changes in the file since it was last committed; you will need to stage them again for the changes to be added in the next commit

Once you have committed a file that becomes "unmodified," its contents are saved in Git's memory.

- **Not saved in Git memory**: Your file is not saved until you commit the file to Git's memory
- **Saved in Git memory**: Only once you have committed a file, it becomes saved in Git's memory

> Check: Work with a partner and take 3 minutes to write a one-sentence explanation of the difference between untracked and staged files. Get ready to share it.
