# Cloning the class Repository

## Objective
Everyone will fork this repository to your own account and work out of it. This will allow you to make changes and additions, and store your work on the GitHub Enterprise server while keeping your work separate from everyone else's.

### Step 1. Fork the repository

First, [fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo) this [repository](https://git.generalassemb.ly/prudential-infrastructure-developer/02-python-for-developers-classwork) by clicking the fork button at the top right of the page.

Choose to fork this repository to your account by clicking your GitHub username when prompted.

### Step 2. Clone your fork

Next, clone your fork to your local machine by copying the SSH link from your repository.

Navigate to your home directory:

```sh
cd ~
```

And run the command, replacing `YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME` with your GitHub username.
*You can also copy the SSH link from your forked repo in your github acct to get the full link.*
*look for the green 'code' button that has the drop down menu and you will see 'ssh' as an option*

```sh
git clone git@git.generalassemb.ly:YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/02-python-for-developers-classwork.git
```


Move into the directory you just cloned:
```sh
cd 02-python-for-developers-classwork
```

### Step 3. Setup the upstream

Sometimes during class, the instructional team will make changes to the repository. To make sure you're able to get these changes, you must set the original repository as your `remote` `upstream`.

Let's go and grab the URL for the **original repository** (not your fork of it). The URL should be something like `git@git.generalassemb.ly:prudential-infrastructure-developer/02-python-for-developers-classwork.git`

Issue the following command, noting the URL:

```bash
git remote add upstream git@git.generalassemb.ly:prudential-infrastructure-developer/02-python-for-developers-classwork.git
```

*Note: The screenshot shows a different repo, but the UI layout is the same.*

## Fetching changes

During the course, the instructional team may make changes or additions to the repository. In order to fetch these changes, you will need to run:

```bash
git pull upstream main
```

Git will pull the changes down to your local forked repo. Try running it now to make sure there are no errors. 

**Please reach out to the instructional team immediately if you encounter any errors or have any questions about these instructions.**
