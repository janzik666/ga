## Terminal Practice

1. Print the current working directory
   ```pwd```
2. Navigate to your home folder
   ``` cd ~```
   The tilde `~` character is a shortcut to your home folder and will be different for each account on a system.
3. Type `pwd` again. What do you see?
4. Create a new folder
   ```mkdir terminal-practice```
5. Navigate to the `terminal-practice` folder without typing out the entire folder name. Type `cd ter`, then hit the TAB key. The terminal will automagically fill in the rest! Once you see the entire command (`cd terminal-practice`) hit enter.
6. Create a new file
   ```touch 1.txt```
7. Type `ls -la` and locate your created file.
8. Let's add some text to the file.
   ```echo I love the terminal > 1.txt ```
9. View the contents of the file using the `less` command
   ```less 1.txt```
   You should see the text you just added. Type `q` to exit the `less` utility. It will drop you back to the terminal.
10. Rename the file
    ```mv 1.txt 01.txt```
11. Type `ls -la` again. Do you see the renamed files?
12. Copy the file
    ```cp 01.txt 02.txt```
13. Type `ls -la` again. You should see both files.
14. Open the `02.txt` file using VS Code.
    ```code 02.txt```
15. In VS Code, change the text to say `Now you love it too` and save the file.
16. Back in the terminal, type `ls -la` again.
17. Let's move both of these files to a new folder. Create the folder
    ```sh
    mkdir txt
    mv *.txt txt
    ```
18. Type `ls -la` again. Notice both files are gone, and now you have a folder named `txt`.
19. List the files in the `txt` folder
    ```ls -la txt```
20. Next we want to delete all the files and folders we just created. Check the current directory
    ``pwd``
    Make sure you're in the `terminal-practice` directory!
21. Traverse up one level
    ```cd ..```
22. Do another `pwd` and make sure you're in your home directory.
23. Type `rm -r terminal-practice` to recursively delete all files in the `terminal-practice` folder as well as the folder itself.
24. Use the `find` command to ensure the folder is gone
    ```find term*```
    You should see `find: ‘term*’: No such file or directory`

Feel free to practice again if you need to. These commands will be used repeatedly, so building muscle memory with the terminal will make your life easier!
