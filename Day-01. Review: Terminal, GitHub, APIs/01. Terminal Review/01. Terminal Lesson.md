- Explain how to navigate through directories in the terminal
- Create, copy, move, and remove files from the terminal

## GUI vs CLI

GUI stands for Graphical User Interface.

CLI stands for Command Line Interface.

Most apps you're used to using are GUIs (pronounced gooey). But before we had GUIs, all we had on computers were CLIs (who remembers MS DOS?).

The CLI, or terminal, is an application that provides direct access to the operating system's internal workings.

What do we use it for?

- Navigating the file system
- Creating, copying, moving, and renaming files
- Working with Git
- Installing system applications (e.g. homebrew, npm)
- Working with Node Package Manager
- Running local servers
- Running build scripts
- Deployment of apps (e.g. heroku, netlify, Github, AWS)
- Connecting to and controlling remote machines

Terminal takes a bit of getting used to, but it will become a fast way of working with all sorts of tools.

The good news is that you'll use it daily as a developer, so you'll get used to it very quickly!

### Opening Terminal

The Terminal app is found on your Virtual Box desktop or Workspace dock.
