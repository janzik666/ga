# APIs

### Objectives
In this lesson, you will:
- Make HTTP requests for data to external API sources.
- Evaluate API documentation to determine data contents, accessibility, and request formatting.

### Open Weather API - 10 mins

Before starting, we'll need an API key to use a weather API for our first coding challenge, so let's walk through the process together as described in their [documentation](https://openweathermap.org/appid). 

Don't worry: we'll learn what a key is, and why it's important, later on!

It may take their system a little time to respond with your unique API key, but they should be in place by the time we get to our code challenge.

## What are APIs?

APIs or (Application Programming Interfaces) are a way for different software applications to communicate with each other, even when applications are based on completely different technologies. They define the methods for requesting and sending data between these applications. Think about how websites like Yelp or Google Maps can show you data from other websites, like restaurant reviews or directions. APIs are the way that these websites share data with each other. What about when websites ask for your location or access to your camera? That's also done through APIs, more specifically known as Web APIs.

APIs can be used to access data from a variety of sources, including databases, web services, and other software applications. They can also be used to perform a wide range of tasks, such as sending and receiving data, updating information, and executing specific functions.

APIs can also help abstract the complexity of a system. For example, when you use a library in Python, you don't need to know how the library was implemented. You just need to know how to use it. The library's API is the set of functions that you can call to interact with the library.

Think of a VCR Player. You don't need to know how the VCR player works internally to use it. You just need to know how to use the buttons on the remote control. The remote control is the API for the VCR player.


## Understanding APIs that provide data as a service

For the remainder of this lesson, we will focus on APIs that provide data as a service. These APIs allow you to access data from a remote server. This data can be anything from weather information to stock prices to social media posts.

First, let's consider a scenario:

Have you ever needed information that wasn't readily available? For example, you might need reference data, real-time updates, or information from an external vendor or another team within your organization.

How did you find that information, and what challenges did you face? 


### What Kind of Data Is Served Up With an API?

It’d be difficult to find data that doesn’t have an API. Common uses are:

- Social media integration: When you post something on Instagram, you can automatically have it post to Facebook as well.
- Payment APIs: When you want to send or receive money via Venmo or the Cash App, the app directly interfaces with your bank or financial institution.
- Maps: Many apps like Uber, Lyft, and Waze are built on top of existing map services like Google Maps or Mapbox.

## Requesting Data

### APIs Sound Great! How Do I Get Started?

API requests use HTTP, so the way to request information from an API may look somewhat familiar to you!

`http://www.domain.com:1234/path/to/resource?a=b&x=y`

It’s a URL address, like what you type when you want to go to any website. But there’s more here than meets the eye. Let’s talk about each part of this address individually.

### Request Methods

| GET                     | POST                    | PUT                     | DELETE                  |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| Retrieve information.   | Send information.       | Update information.     | Delete information.     |
| Used by your browser's address bar every time you visit a website. | Used by most forms to submit data, such as logging in or creating a new post. | Requests to change information in a database. | |

### Requesting Data With requests

Once you have identified an address and a method, you can send a request using Python's requests library.

```py
import requests
data = requests.get(address)
```

**What other methods might there be?**

### JSON

API endpoints will almost always return JSON-formatted data.

```json
{
  "data": "car",
  "make": "ford",
  "model": "focus",
  "details": {
    "color": "blue",
    "mileage": "54019"
  }
}
```

**Does this look like a Python data structure?**

### Dealing With JSON

It's **JSON** (JavaScript Object Notation).

However, the **requests** library has a built-in JSON decoder to turn JSON into a Python dictionary.

```py
data = request.get(address)
parsed_data = data.json()
```

### Many-Layered Objects

API response objects are infamously complex in their formats. To dig down to the layer of information you actually want, carefully examine one layer at a time until you reach the data you’re looking for.

```json
response = {
  "data": "car",
  "make": "ford",
  "model": "focus",
  "details": {
    "color": "blue",
    "mileage": "54019"
  }
}
```

```py
print(response)
# gives us the whole dictionary

print(response["details"])
# gives us the smaller dictionary

print(response["details"]["color"])
# finally, gives us "blue"
```

### API Keys

Many APIs require you to include a key with your request. You can think of this like a password that prevents someone from misusing the API.

Keys are also used to track your requests for rate limits and potential charges. Don’t worry, most APIs have a free tier! You can register with the API’s website to receive your unique key.


## Evaluating APIs

### Read the Docs

Every API is unique — you will have to explore its documentation to figure out what data you want to access and what URL to use in order to send requests. However, there are a few standard details to check for in any API:

- Do I need an API key?
  - If so, are there rate limits or charges for requests?
  - How do I include the key in my requests?
- What are the available endpoints for data?
  - What URL format can search for specific data?
- What will the response data look like?
  - Typically, the response will be JSON. 


## Recap

In today’s class, we:
- Made HTTP requests for data to external API sources.
- Evaluated API documentation to determine data contents, accessibility, and request formatting.
