# Group exercise - API Scavenger Hunt (60 mins)

Use any API from the link below and make requests to answer as many questions as you can. Most of these can be done without any additional API signups.

* [Public APIs](https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis)

Here are some example APIs to look for:

* Pok√©mon Challenge: find all of Pikachu's abilities, and a set of different sized images of Pikachu. See if you can display the abilities and the images.
* How many Yen will my $100 US Dollars convert to at today's exchange rates? 
* Find some real time data on all the tube lines in the London Underground.
* Find the current position (lat/long) of the International Space Station
* What does "epistemology" mean? Use a dictionary API to display a definition.
