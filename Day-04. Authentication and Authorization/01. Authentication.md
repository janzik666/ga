# Authentication
_After this lesson, students will:_

-   **Explain** the difference between Authentication and Authorization
-   **Understand** how to add authentication to FastAPI application, with considerations such as  
  - how to use JWT to create a login token
  - be able to explain the flow of authentication, from registration to signup.
-   **Create** an authenticated `register` and `login` endpoints, that they can interact with using Postman.

Today we're going to be adding some access control to our FastAPI application through Authentication and Authorization. Here's the difference between those two concepts:

**Authentication**: Are you who you say you are?

The ability to register and login falls into this category. In order to provide granular access control, we need a way to determine *who* or *what* we're granting access to.

**Authorization**: Are you allowed to do what you are trying to do?

This ability to set permissions based on API routes, or based on interaction with certain objects, falls into this description.

We'll update our API to allow users to create unique accounts, and we'll give them the ability to own various records (such as teas) that only they can control.

Unauthenticated users can be given the ability to GET data, but not POST, PUT, or DELETE. Or we could choose to make the API entirely private, and only accessible to users with the right permissions.

## Naive User Registration

It's useful to consider what it might look like to sign up users to our API, without considering authorization at all. Then we can look at this approach and think about the problems that it has.

### Creating the user model

We need to create a user model to represent our users. In this approach, theres's not much difference between `Users` and `Teas`, or any other data model. It's all the same.

**You should copy this code into your own API. This code will be the same for everyone.** 

**models/user.py**

```py
# models/user.py
from sqlalchemy import Column, Integer, String, Boolean
from .base import BaseModel


class UserModel(BaseModel):

  # ! This will be used directly to make a
  # ! TABLE in Postgresql
  __tablename__ = "users"

  id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True)

  # ! Specific columns for our Tea Table.
  username = Column(String, unique=True)
  email = Column(String, unique=True)
```

Here we have a user model, with a `username` and `email` fields, that inherits from our `BaseModel`. We've also made the `username` and `email` fields unique.

### Creating the user serializer

We'll also need a serializer for `users` that should look similar to the serializer we have for `teas`.

**Note:** By request, we are not having our users register with a password.

Create the following `serializers/user.py` file:

```py
# serializers/user.py
from pydantic import BaseModel
from typing import Optional, List

class UserSchema(BaseModel):
  username: str
  email: str

  class Config:
    orm_mode = True
```

### Creating the users controller

And of course we'll need a controller for `users`.

Create `controllers/users.py` as follows:

```py
# controllers/users.py

from fastapi import APIRouter, Depends, HTTPException
from sqlalchemy.orm import Session
from models.user import UserModel
from serializers.user import UserSchema
from typing import List
from database import get_db

router = APIRouter()

@router.post("/register", response_model=UserSchema)
def create_user(user: UserSchema, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
    new_user = UserModel(**user.dict())
    db.add(new_user)
    db.commit()
    db.refresh(new_user)
    return new_user

```

Here we've set up a POST endpoint that allows you to `/register` a user.

And lastly, we'll need to update our `main.py` file to register our new users controller:

```py
# main.py

from fastapi import FastAPI
from sqlalchemy import create_engine
from sqlalchemy.orm import sessionmaker, Session
from config.environment import db_URI
from controllers.teas import router as TeasRouter
from controllers.users import router as UsersRouter  # Import users router
from database import get_db

app = FastAPI()

app.include_router(TeasRouter, prefix="/api")
app.include_router(UsersRouter, prefix="/api")  # Include users router

@app.get('/')
def home():
    return 'Hello World!'
```

### Seeding the database with test user data

To be able to test this code quickly, we've also a `seed.py` file and some `user_data` to seed. Here are those files:

**./seed.py**
```py
# seed.py
from sqlalchemy.orm import Session, sessionmaker
from models.base import Base
from models.tea import TeaModel
from models.comment import CommentModel
from data.tea_data import teas_list, comments_list
from data.user_data import user_list
from config.environment import db_URI
from sqlalchemy import create_engine

engine = create_engine(db_URI)
SessionLocal = sessionmaker(bind=engine)

# ! This seed file is a separate program that can be used to "seed" our database with some initial data.
try:
  print("Recreating database..")
  Base.metadata.drop_all(bind=engine)
  Base.metadata.create_all(bind=engine)

  print("seeding our database..")
  # ! Seed teas
  db = SessionLocal()
  db.add_all(teas_list)
  db.commit()

  db.add_all(comments_list)
  db.commit()

  db.add_all(user_list)
  db.commit()

  db.close()

  print("bye ðŸ‘‹")
except Exception as e:
  print(e)

```

**data/user_data.py**

```py
from models.user import UserModel

user_list = [
    UserModel(username="nick123", email="nick@nick.com"),
    UserModel(username="charles", email="charles@charles.com"),
    UserModel(username="adam1Aa", email="adam@adam.com")
]
```

You can add any test users you like in this file!

To seed your database (and create the users table): `pipenv run python seed.py`

Now let's test this code and think about it. You should run a POST request to the `/register` endpoint and then check the database to see if the new user record has been created.

Once we do that, you should see a response back.

## Login route

For login, we're going to use **[JWT](https://jwt.io/)** (JSON Web Tokens) to uniquely authenticate a user. If a user tries to login with exactly the same password they registered with, we'll create a JWT for them, which can use later on in the authorization process. 

Again we'll need a library for this. Let's install `pyjwt`:

```sh
pipenv install pyjwt
```

We can now write a function that generates a token. We'll add it to the `User` model, not forgetting to import `datetime`, and `timedelta` as Python modules also.

Please note that the actual generation of this token will come from a separate service in a real-world scenario, but for our purposes today, we'll build this function onto the user model.

**models/user.py**

```py
from datetime import datetime, timedelta
import jwt
from sqlalchemy import Column, Integer, String
from .base import Base

# Import the secret from the environment file
from config.environment import secret

class UserModel(Base):
  __tablename__ = "users"

  id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True)
  username = Column(String, nullable=False, unique=True)
  email = Column(String, nullable=False, unique=True)

  def generate_token(self):
    # Create a token for this user.
    payload = {
      "exp": datetime.utcnow() + timedelta(days=1),
      "iat": datetime.utcnow(),
      "sub": self.id,
    }

    token = jwt.encode(
      payload,
      secret,
      algorithm="HS256",
    )
    
    return token

```

The `generate_token` has been added to the `user` as a method, so `self` refers to the user that is logging in. We create a JWT using the `encode` method. Notice that we are importing a secret from `config/enviroment.py` (we'll add this next).

**config/environment.py**

```py
db_URI = "postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/teas_db"
secret = "mysecretcode"
```

With that in place we can write our login route:

```py
# controllers/users.py

from fastapi import APIRouter, Depends, HTTPException
from sqlalchemy.orm import Session
from models.user import UserModel
from serializers.user import UserSchema, UserLogin, UserToken
from typing import List
from database import get_db

router = APIRouter()

@router.post("/register", response_model=UserSchema)
def create_user(user: UserSchema, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
    new_user = UserModel(**user.dict())
    db.add(new_user)
    db.commit()
    db.refresh(new_user)
    return new_user

@router.post("/login", response_model=UserToken)
def login(user: UserLogin, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
    db_user = db.query(UserModel).filter(UserModel.username == user.username).first()
    if not db_user:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=400, detail="Incorrect username")

    token = db_user.generate_token()
    return {"token": token, "message": "Welcome back!"}

```

Please note that we'll also need to update our serializer to include an interface for UserLogin as well as UserToken:

```py
# serializers/user.py

from pydantic import BaseModel
from typing import Optional, List

class UserSchema(BaseModel):
  username: str
  email: str

class UserLogin(BaseModel):
  username: str

class UserToken(BaseModel):
  token: str

  class Config:
    orm_mode = True
```

Now we can test out the login route and we should see a token in the response.

Well done! In the next lesson, we'll be moving onto Authorization, where we'll actually see the usage of this token in controlling the permissions a user has to certain routes and resources.

## Stretch goal

The goal here is to walk through what authentication and password management *could* look like. In a real world scenario, these operations would likely be managed be an entirely separate department that is responsible for identity management.

### Password hashing with Passlib

The gold standard for dealing with passwords is to hash them before storing them in the database. There are many Python libraries we can use to help us with this. Most use `passlib[bcrypt]`.

Install passlib as follows:
`pipenv install passlib`

### Updating a user model

Here's what a possible implementation could look like. First you would have a field on the user model called `password_hash`. This will be what actually gets stored in the database. Also, there would be a function on our user model to set the password.

**models/user.py**
```py
from passlib.context import CryptContext
from sqlalchemy import Column, Integer, String
from .base import Base

pwd_context = CryptContext(schemes=["bcrypt"], deprecated="auto")

class UserModel(Base):
    __tablename__ = "users"

    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True)
    username = Column(String, nullable=False, unique=True)
    email = Column(String, nullable=False, unique=True)
    password_hash = Column(String, nullable=True) # We're storing a hashed version of our password here

    # We'll create this method to to set the hashed password
    def set_password(self, password):
        self.password_hash = pwd_context.hash(password)
```

If you see above the `set_password` function uses the `pwd_context` to hash the password and sets the hash to the user's `password_hash` property.
