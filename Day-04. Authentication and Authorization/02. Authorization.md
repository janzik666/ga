# Authorization
_After this lesson, students will:_

-   **Explain** how we can use Authorization to implement route and object level permissions
-   **Understand** the decorator pattern in python
-   **Implement** a `secure_route` decorator that can verify login tokens for us.
-   **Implement** object level permissions on routes.

Now our app is authenticated, we'll be moving on to Authorization. The difference again:

**Authentication**: Are you who you say you are?

**Authorization**: Are you allowed to do what you are trying to do?

Authorization allows us to add permissions to our API in different ways. The 2 ways of authorizing that we'll be looking at:
1. **Route level permissions**. This will restrict and control who can access which routes. e.g. Only logged in users can POST a tea.
2. **Object level permissions**. This will restrict and control the operations someone can perform on certain resources. e.g. Only the user who created a tea can update that tea.

We'll be looking at point 1 first. Before we jump into that, we need to briefly talk about FastAPI's **Depends**.

This will be necessary, because decorators will allow us to annotate certain functions as routes that are only accessible to logged in users. 

Essentially this will allow to us to run some verification code, on whichever routes we choose, _before_ the user ever reaches the controller level.


## Understanding FastAPI's `Depends` - 45 min

Before we start to secure our routes, we need to take a closer look at `Depends`. We've already used this syntax when obtaining a database session for some of our routes, but now we're going to take a closer look. 

FastAPI's `Depends` is an integral part of the framework, which is crucial for requiring dependencies in your API. It's a powerful function that simplifies the process of handling dependencies across your routes.

### What is `Depends`?

`Depends` is a function used to declare dependencies for your route functions. These dependencies can be anything that your route requires to function properly: a database session, a current user, a security routine, a rate limiter, etc.

By using `Depends`, you instruct FastAPI to resolve the dependency and provide it to your route function. FastAPI will also handle errors and provide helpful response messages if something goes wrong.

### How does `Depends` work?

You call `Depends` within the function signature of your route and pass your dependency function as an argument. FastAPI will resolve the dependency when the route is called. Here's an example:

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI, Depends
from typing import Optional

app = FastAPI()

def common_parameters(q: Optional[str] = None, skip: int = 0, limit: int = 100):
    return {"q": q, "skip": skip, "limit": limit}

@app.get("/items/")
def read_items(commons: dict = Depends(common_parameters)):
    return commons
```

In the above example, when `read_items` route is hit, FastAPI first calls the `common_parameters` function and then passes the return value to `read_items` as `commons` argument.

### Advantages of `Depends`

1. **Readability and Maintainability**: Using `Depends` clearly expresses the dependencies of your routes, making your code easier to understand and maintain.

2. **Reusability**: You can create dependencies that take other dependencies as parameters, allowing you to reuse dependencies in different parts of your application.

3. **Automatic error handling**: FastAPI will automatically handle errors during dependency resolution, providing helpful error messages to the client.

4. **Testing**: By using `Depends`, you can easily replace dependencies during testing, which makes testing your application more straightforward.

### Conclusion

FastAPI's `Depends` is a key part of achieving a clean, maintainable, and reusable code structure. By understanding and using `Depends`, you can take full advantage of FastAPI's powerful features to build robust and efficient APIs.

## Securing routes - 45 min

We're going to write the `get_current_user` function as a dependency to our application. This file essentially provides a security check for your FastAPI application. It ensures that every request to protected routes comes from authenticated users by verifying their tokens. It decodes the provided token, validates it, and retrieves the corresponding user data, therefore confirming that the user is authorized to make the request.

In your application's folder:
```sh
mkdir dependencies
```

```py
# dependencies/get_current_user.py
from fastapi import Depends, HTTPException, status
from fastapi.security import HTTPBearer
from sqlalchemy.orm import Session
from models.user import UserModel
from database import get_db
import jwt
from jwt import DecodeError, ExpiredSignatureError # We import specific exceptions to handle them explicitly
from config.environment import secret

# We're using HTTP Bearer scheme for Authorization header
http_bearer = HTTPBearer()

def get_current_user(db: Session = Depends(get_db), token: str = Depends(http_bearer)):
    # This function is a dependency that takes in the database session and the JWT token from the request header

    try:
        # We try to decode the token using the secret key
        payload = jwt.decode(token.credentials, secret, algorithms=["HS256"])

        # We then query the database to find the user with the id specified in the token's payload
        user = db.query(UserModel).filter(UserModel.id == payload.get("sub")).first()

        # If the user doesn't exist, we raise an HTTP 401 Unauthorized error
        if not user:
            raise HTTPException(status_code=status.HTTP_401_UNAUTHORIZED,
                                detail="Invalid username or password")

    # If there is a DecodeError while decoding the token, we raise an HTTP 403 Forbidden error
    except DecodeError as e:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=status.HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN,
                        detail=f'Could not decode token: {str(e)}')

    # If the token has expired, we also raise an HTTP 403 Forbidden error
    except ExpiredSignatureError:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=status.HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN,
                            detail='Token has expired')

    # If everything is successful, we return the user
    return user


```
The function takes a JSON Web Token (JWT) from the Authorization header of the incoming HTTP request (this is accomplished by using FastAPI's Depends mechanism with http_bearer).

The JWT is then decoded using a secret key. The payload of the JWT should contain the "subject" of the token, which in this case is expected to be the ID of a user ("sub" field).

The user ID is used to fetch the corresponding user record from the database. If the user does not exist or the JWT could not be decoded correctly, an appropriate HTTP error is raised.

Now, we'll need to update our teas controller to ensure that the routes are protected. For our example let's only protect the following routes:
* `POST /teas`
* `PUT /teas/:id`
* `DELETE /teas/:id`

Here is the updated controller:

**controllers/teas**

```py
# controllers/teas.py

from fastapi import APIRouter, Depends, HTTPException, Security
from sqlalchemy.orm import Session
from models.tea import TeaModel
from models.user import UserModel # import user model
from serializers.tea import TeaSchema
from typing import List
from database import get_db
from dependencies.get_current_user import get_current_user # import this function

router = APIRouter()

@router.get("/teas", response_model=List[TeaSchema])
def get_teas(db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
    teas = db.query(TeaModel).all()  
    return teas

@router.get("/teas/{tea_id}", response_model=TeaSchema)
def get_single_tea(tea_id: int, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
    tea = db.query(TeaModel).filter(TeaModel.id == tea_id).first()
    if not tea:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=404, detail="Tea not found")
    return tea

@router.post("/teas", response_model=TeaSchema)
def create_tea(tea: TeaSchema, db: Session = Depends(get_db), current_user: UserModel = Depends(get_current_user)): # Add this
    new_tea = TeaModel(**tea.dict())
    db.add(new_tea)
    db.commit()
    db.refresh(new_tea)
    return new_tea

@router.put("/teas/{tea_id}", response_model=TeaSchema)
def update_tea(tea_id: int, tea: TeaSchema, db: Session = Depends(get_db), current_user: UserModel = Depends(get_current_user)): # Add this
    # find the tea to update
    db_tea = db.query(TeaModel).filter(TeaModel.id == tea_id).first()
    if not db_tea:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=404, detail="Tea not found")

    # update the tea
    tea_data = tea.dict(exclude_unset=True)
    for key, value in tea_data.items():
        setattr(db_tea, key, value)

    db.commit()
    db.refresh(db_tea)
    return db_tea

@router.delete("/teas/{tea_id}")
def delete_tea(tea_id: int, db: Session = Depends(get_db), current_user: UserModel = Depends(get_current_user)): # Add this
    # find the tea to delete
    db_tea = db.query(TeaModel).filter(TeaModel.id == tea_id).first()
    if not db_tea:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=404, detail="Tea not found")

    db.delete(db_tea)
    db.commit()
    return {"message": f"Tea {tea_id} deleted successfully"}
```

In the above example, we've secured our three routes by using the Depends functionality. Ultimately, before the request on those routes is processed, it first runs the `get_current_user` function and then passes the return value from that function to our request. If the token is not supplied or it is not valid, then the the request does not execute.

Let's test this out:

Let's first attempt to run a `POST /teas` request in FastAPI's interactive console (`127.0.0.1:8000/docs`) without logging in. When you execute that request you should see a 403 response with the message `Not authenticated`. This means that we've successfully protected this route.

Now let's try to submit an authenticated request to the `POST /teas` endpoint. First, try logging in by hitting the `POST /login` endpoint within FastAPI's interactive console. Be sure to use the correct username. You should receive a successful 200 response along with the actual token value. The token value should be a very long string value with a series of numbers and letters. Copy that token, but do not include the surrounding quotes.

Now click the AUTHORIZE button on the upper right hand corner and in the input box on the popup paste in your token. Click authorize and you should now be "logged in".

Finally, go back to running your `POST /teas` request. You should receive a 200 response. As a final check, look at your actual teas table in `psql` to make sure that the new tea has saved. If it has, then congratulations, you've successfully protected your routes!


## Permissions On Objects - 45 min

So the above is great, as it allows to us restrict many of our CRUD operations to simply logged in users. 

However, for requirement 2, we need more granularity than this. 

If you want to limit the updating/deleting of a tea to only the user who posted that tea, you now need a **relationship** between teas and users. 

We've covered this same relationship before, with Comments. Now, let's create a relationship between teas and users. First we'll work on the models:

```py
# models/tea.py
from sqlalchemy import Column, Integer, String, Boolean, ForeignKey
from sqlalchemy.orm import relationship
from .base import BaseModel
from .comment import CommentModel
from .user import UserModel

class TeaModel(BaseModel):

  __tablename__ = "teas"

  id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True)

  # ! Specific columns for our Tea Table.
  name = Column(String, unique=True)
  in_stock = Column(Boolean)
  rating = Column(Integer)

  # Foreign key for User
  user_id = Column(Integer, ForeignKey('users.id'))

  # Many (TeaModel) to One (UserModel) relationship
  user = relationship('UserModel', back_populates='teas')

  comments = relationship("CommentModel", back_populates="tea", cascade="all, delete-orphan")
```

```py
# models/user.py
from datetime import datetime, timedelta
import jwt
from sqlalchemy import Column, Integer, String
from sqlalchemy.orm import relationship
from .base import BaseModel

from config.environment import secret

class UserModel(BaseModel):
  __tablename__ = "users"

  id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True)
  username = Column(String, nullable=False, unique=True)
  email = Column(String, nullable=False, unique=True)

  # One (UserModel) to Many (TeaModel) relationship
  teas = relationship('TeaModel', back_populates='user')

  def generate_token(self):
    payload = {
      "exp": datetime.utcnow() + timedelta(days=1),
      "iat": datetime.utcnow(),
      "sub": self.id,
    }

    token = jwt.encode(
      payload,
      secret,
      algorithm="HS256",
    )
    
    return token
```

Here we've added the necessary relationships on the model. Let's now update our tea serializer so that the user association is displayed:

```py
# serializers/tea.py
from pydantic import BaseModel
from typing import Optional, List
from .comment import CommentSchema
from .user import UserSchema # Import the User schema

class TeaSchema(BaseModel):
  id: int
  name: str
  in_stock: bool
  rating: int
  user: UserSchema # Each tea belongs to a user

  comments: List[CommentSchema] = []

  class Config:
    orm_mode = True
```

So we've just implemented the relationship. We should test the implementation now to make sure we did it correctly. It will be much easier to test this through seeding, rather than making requests. So let's update our `tea_data.py`.

**data/tea_data.py**

```py
from models.tea import TeaModel
from models.comment import CommentModel
from models.user import UserModel # Import user model

teas_list = [
  TeaModel(name="chai", rating=4, in_stock=True, user_id=1),
  TeaModel(name="earl grey", rating=3, in_stock=False, user_id=2)
]

# ! Specify the tea_id on the CommentModel, to associate it with a tea
comments_list = [CommentModel(content="This is a great tea", tea_id=1)]

```

Here we've added a `user_id` for every tea generated. We've also imported the User model up top. But we need to change one thing on the actual `seed.py` file:

```py
# seed.py
from sqlalchemy.orm import Session, sessionmaker
from passlib.context import CryptContext
from models.base import Base
from models.tea import TeaModel
from models.comment import CommentModel
from data.tea_data import teas_list, comments_list
from data.user_data import user_list
from config.environment import db_URI
from sqlalchemy import create_engine

engine = create_engine(db_URI)
SessionLocal = sessionmaker(bind=engine)

# ! This seed file is a separate program that can be used to "seed" our database with some initial data.
try:
  print("Recreating database..")
  Base.metadata.drop_all(bind=engine)
  Base.metadata.create_all(bind=engine)

  print("seeding our database..")
  # ! Seed teas
  db = SessionLocal()
  db.add_all(user_list) # Make sure to seed the users BEFORE the teas
  db.commit()

  db.add_all(teas_list)
  db.commit()

  db.add_all(comments_list)
  db.commit()


  db.close()

  print("bye 👋")
except Exception as e:
  print(e)

```

In our seed program, we need to make sure that we've generated user records BEFORE the teas since the user records are required to generate the teas because of the relationship we just created.

Run `pipenv run python seed.py`, and check your database, to see that teas are now being created with users. If so, then we've successfully set up the relationship.

Now we'll need to work on the teas controller. What we'll want to do here is to make sure that when a new tea record is created, that the user_id is objected on that record to the current user that is logged in.


```py
# controllers/teas.py

from fastapi import APIRouter, Depends, HTTPException, Security
from sqlalchemy.orm import Session
from models.tea import TeaModel
from models.user import UserModel
from serializers.tea import TeaSchema, TeaCreate as TeaCreateSchema # Add a new schema for tea creation
from typing import List
from database import get_db
from dependencies.get_current_user import get_current_user

router = APIRouter()

@router.get("/teas", response_model=List[TeaSchema])
def get_teas(db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
    teas = db.query(TeaModel).all()  
    return teas

@router.get("/teas/{tea_id}", response_model=TeaSchema)
def get_single_tea(tea_id: int, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
    tea = db.query(TeaModel).filter(TeaModel.id == tea_id).first()
    if not tea:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=404, detail="Tea not found")
    return tea

@router.post("/teas", response_model=TeaSchema)
def create_tea(tea: TeaCreateSchema, db: Session = Depends(get_db), current_user: UserModel = Depends(get_current_user)):
    # Create a new tea instance.
    # Assign the user_id of the tea to the id of the current user.
    new_tea = TeaModel(**tea.dict(), user_id=current_user.id)
    db.add(new_tea)
    db.commit()
    db.refresh(new_tea)
    return new_tea

@router.put("/teas/{tea_id}", response_model=TeaSchema)
def update_tea(tea_id: int, tea: TeaSchema, db: Session = Depends(get_db), current_user: UserModel = Depends(get_current_user)):
    db_tea = db.query(TeaModel).filter(TeaModel.id == tea_id).first()
    if not db_tea:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=404, detail="Tea not found")

    tea_data = tea.dict(exclude_unset=True)
    for key, value in tea_data.items():
        setattr(db_tea, key, value)

    db.commit()
    db.refresh(db_tea)
    return db_tea

@router.delete("/teas/{tea_id}")
def delete_tea(tea_id: int, db: Session = Depends(get_db), current_user: UserModel = Depends(get_current_user)):
    db_tea = db.query(TeaModel).filter(TeaModel.id == tea_id).first()
    if not db_tea:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=404, detail="Tea not found")

    db.delete(db_tea)
    db.commit()
    return {"message": f"Tea {tea_id} deleted successfully"}
```

You'll notice here that we are now saving the current user to the new tea record we created in the POST /teas endpoint. Also note that we've added a new schema to our teas serailizer:

```py
# serializers/tea.py
from pydantic import BaseModel
from typing import Optional, List
from .comment import CommentSchema
from .user import UserSchema

class TeaSchema(BaseModel):
  id: int
  name: str
  in_stock: bool
  rating: int
  user: UserSchema

  comments: List[CommentSchema] = []

  class Config:
    orm_mode = True

class TeaCreate(BaseModel): #Add a new schema for tea creation
    name: str
    in_stock: bool
    rating: int
```

The new schema will be neccessary for creating a new tea.

Now go ahead and create a new tea record through FastAPI's interactive console. You'll likely need to "login" again in order to perform the operations. Once done, you can check to make sure that the tea record was successfully created along with the associated `user_id` by viewing the tea records in `psql`.

Now onto our last step! We'll now need to build in logic into our PUT and DELETE routes, where we check the current logged in user against the user assigned to the tea record that's being referenced in the route. If the user_ids do not match, we return a 402 response and do not perform the operation. If not, we complete the operation. See below for revised PUT and DELETE routes:

```py
@router.put("/teas/{tea_id}", response_model=TeaSchema)
def update_tea(tea_id: int, tea: TeaCreateSchema, db: Session = Depends(get_db), current_user: UserModel = Depends(get_current_user)):
    db_tea = db.query(TeaModel).filter(TeaModel.id == tea_id).first()
    if not db_tea:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=404, detail="Tea not found")
    
    # Check if the current user is the creator of the tea
    if db_tea.user_id != current_user.id:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=403, detail="Operation forbidden")

    tea_data = tea.dict(exclude_unset=True)
    for key, value in tea_data.items():
        setattr(db_tea, key, value)

    db.commit()
    db.refresh(db_tea)
    return db_tea

@router.delete("/teas/{tea_id}")
def delete_tea(tea_id: int, db: Session = Depends(get_db), current_user: UserModel = Depends(get_current_user)):
    db_tea = db.query(TeaModel).filter(TeaModel.id == tea_id).first()
    if not db_tea:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=404, detail="Tea not found")

    # Check if the current user is the creator of the tea
    if db_tea.user_id != current_user.id:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=403, detail="Operation forbidden")

    db.delete(db_tea)
    db.commit()
    return {"message": f"Tea {tea_id} deleted successfully"}
```

Once implemented, go ahead and test this out in FastAPI's interactive console. First try to update or delete a tea that does not belong to the current logged in user and you should see the a 403 response along with the message `Operation forbidden`. 

Once you're able to confirm that, we can now proceed to the final check: now go ahead and update or delete a tea record that does belong to the current user that is logged in. You should see the operation go through successfully.

Congratulations! You've successfully secured your routes and implemented object-level permissioning.

Make your own cup of tea!
