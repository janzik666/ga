# üîç Python for Developers - Step 2 Project

## Project Brief

1. Every application that you encounter is generally a CRUD app and we've developed skills throughout this course to be able to do this on your own. Take this opportunity to pick a problem that you want to solve with the implementation of an application for users. 
2. **You don‚Äôt have to do this alone! Partner with someone if you want or go solo.**
3.  You‚Äôll have the opportunity to meet with a Prudential developer who will be available to answer any questions you may have.
    - Your course
    - Recently covered content
    - Questions you may have while working on your PluralSight assignments or Step 2 Project
    - **Prepare your questions in advance and bring them with you to the session.** 
4. **Commit** Your Work To GitHub, **Submit** Your Work via Pull Request


## Project Requirements
1. **Data Model:** 
    - Implement a PostgreSQL database and use SQLAlchemy ORM to perform CRUD. 
    - Set up at least one one-to-many relationship, correctly associating tables.
2. **Endpoints:**
   - Complete implementation of CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) endpoints, each working correctly with the database.
3. **Error Handling:**
    - Comprehensive error handling. Server doesn't crash, provides helpful and specific error messages and handles edge cases gracefully.
4. **Authentication/Authorization:**
    - JWT Authentication
    - Protected routes.
    - Object-level permissioning.
