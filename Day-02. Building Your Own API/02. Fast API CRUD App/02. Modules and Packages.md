# Modules & Packages

As we build more complex applications with Python, it is important that we spilt our code out into more files across multiple folders.

In order to share functionality between files and folders we need to become familiar with Python's `import` syntax and how we can structure our projects.

The `import` syntax is similar to [ES6 (JavaScript)](https://www.w3schools.com/Js/js_es6.asp), with a few important caveats:

1. There is no need to explicitly export data from a file to be used in another file
1. The syntax is the `from <module> import <property>`

## Modules

When structuring our code, each new file becomes a _module_ which allows us to organize our code more effectively.

Let's practice creating and using a module. We want to create a converter module, which converts imperial to metric. We create a `converter.py` where our converter logic will live, and a `main.py` file where we will import our converter to be used in the main business logic:

We've provided a new folder to practice in:

```sh
cd ./exercises/modules_and_packages/modules
```

In your editor, create the `converter.py` file with the following:

```py
"""converter.py"""
ratios = {
  'lbs': 0.453592,
  'stone': 6.35029,
  'fl oz': 28.4131,
  'pint': 568.261
}

def convert(amount, unit):
  return amount * ratios.get(unit, 1)
```

Save the file in the directory you just created.

Next, create the `main.py` with the following:

```py
"""main.py"""
import converter # converter module loaded into memory

unit = input('What do you want to convert? lbs / stone / fl oz / pint ')
amount = float(input('How many %s to convert? ' % unit))
result = converter.convert(amount, unit)
metric = 'kg' if unit in ['lbs', 'stone'] else 'ml'

print('%s %s is %s %s' % (amount, unit, result, metric))
```

Let's test and make sure the program works.

```sh
python3 main.py
```

Here we have imported the whole `converter` module, including the `ratios` dictionary. This is actually not necessary since we do not use `ratios` in the `main.py` file.

Instead we can just import the `convert` method like so:

```py
"""main.py"""
from converter import convert  # <--- Change this line

unit = input('What do you want to convert? lbs / stone / fl oz / pint ')
amount = float(input('How many %ss to convert? ' % unit))
result = convert(amount, unit)  # <--- And this line
print(result)
```

Run the program again and verify it works the same.

## Packages

We can take this idea further with _packages_. A **package** is a collection of **modules** in a dedicated folder, such as `config`. Dot notation can be used to target a specific module in the package.

In order to allow Python to recognize a folder as a package, we need to create an `__init__.py` file in the folder.

You can think of it a bit like the `__init__()` method of a class. If we want to add any initialization logic for the module such as automatically importing dependenceies, we can add it to the `__init__.py` file. Otherwise the file can be left blank, [as long as you're running Python 3.3 or later](https://peps.python.org/pep-0420/).

Consider the following folder structure:

```
.
├── config
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── environment.py
│   └── router.py
└── main.py
```

Let's set this up in `./exercises/modules_and_packages/packagaes`. Create a `config` folder:

```sh
mkdir config
```

Create the `__init__.py` file in the `config` folder:

```sh
touch config/__init__.py
```

Move `converter.py` into the `config` folder:

```sh
mv converter.py config
```

Now type `tree` to verify the files are in the right places. You should see this:

```sh
.
├── config
│   ├── converter.py
│   └── __init__.py
└── main.py

1 directory, 3 files
```

We can now import `converter.py` in `main.py` like so:

```py
from config import converter
```

Change this:

```py
result = convert(amount, unit)
```

To this:

```py
result = converter.convert(amount, unit)
```

Now test the program again; it should work the same. Congratulations, you have created a package!

## When you can omit `__init__.py`

As of Python 3.3, you can omit the `__init__.py` file in a package folder; this is because Python will automatically recognize the folder as a package. However, it is still good practice to include the file, as it allows you to add initialization logic to the package.
