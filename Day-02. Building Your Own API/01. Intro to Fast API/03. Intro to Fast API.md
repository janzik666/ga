# Intro to FastAPI
FastAPI is a modern, fast web framework for building APIs with Python 3.6+ based on standard [Python type hints](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html).

## Setup

The classic *Hello World!* server setup takes just a few lines of code with FastAPI.

1. Create a project directory and install FastAPI using `pipenv`.
2. In addition to FastAPI, we also need to install uvicorn.

```sh
cd ./exercises/hello_world_app
pipenv install fastapi uvicorn
```

Uvicorn is a web server that sits between your FastAPI application and the client that's using the API. You can think of it as a translator between FastAPI and the outside world.

3. Now create a `main.py` file in this directory and import FastAPI:

```py
"""main.py"""
from fastapi import FastAPI

app = FastAPI()

@app.get('/')
def home():
    return 'Hello World!!!!'
```

4. Launch the server with the following command:

```sh
pipenv run uvicorn main:app
```

You should see something similar to the following terminal output:

```txt
INFO:     Started server process [5503]
INFO:     Waiting for application startup.
INFO:     Application startup complete.
INFO:     Uvicorn running on http://127.0.0.1:8000 (Press CTRL+C to quit)
```

5. Open a web browser and navigate to http://127.0.0.1:8000. You should see your Hello World! message.

## Development Mode

You should see your "Hello World!" message in the browser. But notice how when you change the response in `main.py` and refresh your browser, you're still seeing your original "Hello World!" message? To view our changes, we have to end the server and start it again, which can become cumbersome during development.

One advantage of using `uvicorn` to run FastAPI applications is that it supports automatic reloading on code changes. We just need to turn that feature on.

Terminate uvicorn by typing Ctrl+C, then run the same command using the `--reload` flag in the run command.

```sh
pipenv run uvicorn main:app --reload
```

Change the text in the `return` function of the `main.py` file to look like this:

```py
return 'Welcome to my API'
```

Save the file and refresh your browser. You should see the updates dynamically reflected.

Once you're done, type CTRL+C to shut down the webserver.
