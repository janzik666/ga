# `pipenv`

Python comes with its own package manager called `pip`. While `pip` is a great tool, it does have one major flaw. It will install packages globally, meaning that any Python project you start will have access to all the packages you have previously installed.

This becomes a problem when you want to upgrade a package. Perhaps another project on your computer requires the older version. When you upgrade the package, your old project will break. As developers, it is typically preferable to keep a manifest file for each project and ensure that only specific modules are made available for specific projects.

Enter `pipenv`. It is a tool that adds that functionality to your workflow, so that you can manage your Python projects and all of their corresponding dependencies.

**for the exercies below use `./exercises/pip_env_test` folder for practice**

## Installation

You can install `pipenv` with python package manager:

```sh
pip3 install pipenv
```

This will install the `pipenv` module globally, which is exactly what we want.

## Usage

To use `pipenv`, create a new Python project folder and navigate to it.

```
cd ./exercises/pip_env_test
```

Now rather than using `pip` to install dependencies, you can use `pipenv`:

```sh
pipenv install fastapi
```

This will automatically create two key files: `Pipfile` and `Pipfile.lock`. These are used to keep track of the project's dependencies and their versions. It is designed to declare broad dependencies in a more manageable way.

The `Pipfile.lock` is automatically updated each time the `Pipfile` changes. It's a snapshot of the exact versions of each package being used, along with their transitive dependencies, at a specific point in time. This means that if you share your project with someone else, you can guarantee they will install exactly the same dependencies as you have, ensuring consistent behavior across different environments. Keep both of these files in version control. [Look here](https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/pipfile.html) for more details on the differences between `Pipfile` and `Pipfile.lock`.

Using `pipenv` to install your packages means that you can collaborate on projects, simply clone or download the repo and type `pipenv install` to install all the dependencies.

## How it works

When you install a package with `pipenv`, it creates a _virtual environment_ for that project. This mimics a development environment where only the packages you have installed for that project exist. It does this by installing all the packages to a uniquely named folder somewhere in the file system of your laptop.

In the current working directory as your virtual environment, create a file called `main.py` and save the following text in it:

```py
"""main.py"""
import fastapi
print("pipenv is working!")
```

In order to run a project managed by `pipenv` you need to prefix any command with `pipenv run`. So for example:

```sh
# Have Python execute the main.py file in the virtual environment
pipenv run python main.py
```

Confirm that you see the message `pipenv is working!`.
