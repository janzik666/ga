# Creating relationships with SQLAlchemy

Creating relationships between models is vital for any application. Let's look at how we can do that with SQLAlchemy. Here's an example diagram below, that shows some relationships between different entities in a database. 

We're using cheeses here to mix things up!

This a called an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD). The symbols at the ends of the lines represent the kinds of relationships these 3 tables have with each other. 

The 3-line symbol that looks like a crow's foot means 'Many', and the 2 parallel double line symbol means 'One'.

So here we have two types of relationships:

-  One-To-Many (1:M) between Cheeses and Comments because one cheese can have many comments
-  Many-to-Many (M:M) between Cheese and Categories because a category can have many cheeses, and a cheese can have many categories.

We'll be focusing on the 1:M relationship in our app, as this is more common and slightly more straightforward in FastAPI.

## One-to-many (1:M) relationship

Let's apply this database modeling principle to our teas.

Let's start with the relationship between teas and comments:

-   A tea can have **many** comments
-   A comment belongs to **one** tea

### Creating the comments model

Let's start by creating a comment model to represent a comment and its relationship to a tea. Create `models/comment.py` as follows:

```py
# models/comment.py
from sqlalchemy import Column, Integer, String, ForeignKey
from sqlalchemy.orm import relationship
from .base import BaseModel

class CommentModel(BaseModel):

  __tablename__ = "comments"

  id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True)
  content = Column(String, nullable=False)

  # ForeignKey points to the primary key (id) of the teas table
  tea_id = Column(Integer, ForeignKey('teas.id'), nullable=False)
  tea = relationship("TeaModel", back_populates="comments")
```

The comment model specifies three attributes:
 - A unique `id` for the comment (integer)
 - The comment `content` (string)
 - The `tea_id` that the comment pertains to (integer)

Also notice the `ForeignKey`. This indicates that the `tea_id` column is going to store a reference to a tea ID in the `teas` table. SQLAlchemy will ensure that a `tea_id` in the `comments` matches the `id` attribute in the `teas` table. This is called a foreign key constraint, and is crucial to ensure that the mapping between teas and their comments is correct.

> **Note:** It's important that the table name in the argument passed to `ForeignKey` matches the `__tablename__` of the table that you are making a relationship with. In this case, `teas.id` is the argument, `teas` is the table name, and `id` is the key name.

### Updating the teas model

We'll also need to update our teas model to import and include comments like so:

```py
# models/tea.py
from sqlalchemy import Column, Integer, String, Boolean
from sqlalchemy.orm import relationship
from .base import BaseModel
from models.comment import CommentModel # import the CommentModel class

class TeaModel(BaseModel):

  # ! This will be used directly to make a
  # ! TABLE in Postgresql
  __tablename__ = "teas"

  id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True)

  # ! Specific columns for our Tea Table.
  name = Column(String, unique=True)
  in_stock = Column(Boolean)
  rating = Column(Integer)

  comments = relationship("CommentModel", back_populates="tea", cascade="all, delete-orphan")
```

Here you can see we've added the `relationship` method. This tells SQLAlchemy which model it should use when creating and retrieving data from the database. The `back_populates` means that a `comments` property will be created on the `tea` model, referencing all of the comments for each tea. The `cascade` means that when a `tea` is created, all `comments` associated with it will also be deleted.


### Creating the base model

Let's also add a `models/base.py` file. This file will contain logic that all our models can share.

```py
# models/base.py
from sqlalchemy import Column, DateTime, Integer, func
from sqlalchemy.ext.declarative import declarative_base

Base = declarative_base()

class BaseModel(Base):
  __abstract__ = True

  created_at = Column(DateTime, default=func.now())
  updated_at = Column(DateTime, default=func.now(), onupdate=func.now())
```

Here we're adding `created_at` and `updated_at` attributes.

### Updating our `seed.py` and data file

Now that we have our models set up, let's seed some data. First let's instantiate some `Comment` models in `tea_data.py`.

```py
# data/tea_data.py
from models.tea import TeaModel
from models.comment import CommentModel

teas_list = [
    TeaModel(name="chai", rating=4, in_stock=True),
    TeaModel(name="earl grey", rating=3, in_stock=False)
]

# ! Specify the tea_id on the CommentModel, to associate it with a tea
comments_list = [CommentModel(content="This is a great tea", tea_id=1)]

```

And finally update our `seed.py` file, to seed some comments:

```py
# seed.py
from sqlalchemy.orm import sessionmaker
from models.base import Base
from data.tea_data import teas_list, comments_list
from config.environment import db_URI
from sqlalchemy import create_engine

engine = create_engine(db_URI)
SessionLocal = sessionmaker(bind=engine)

# ! This seed file is a separate program that can be used to "seed" our database with some initial data.
try:
  print("Recreating database..")
  Base.metadata.drop_all(bind=engine)
  Base.metadata.create_all(bind=engine)

  print("seeding our database..")
  # ! Seed teas
  db = SessionLocal()
  db.add_all(teas_list)
  db.commit()

  # ! Now seeding comments after teas
  db.add_all(comments_list)
  db.commit()
  db.close()

  print("bye ðŸ‘‹")
except Exception as e:
  print(e)
```

To re-seed: `pipenv run python seed.py`. You should see the script successfully run.

### Verification

To verify, run `psql` and check to see the contents of both the `teas` table and the `comments` table.

```sh
psql -U postgres -d teas_db
```

```sql
select * from teas;
select * from comments;
```

If you see the teas and comments from `data/tea_data.py`, you're good to go!

To quit `psql`, type `\q`.

Now that we have our models set up, we can start to create routes that interact with our database. We'll do this in the next lesson.
