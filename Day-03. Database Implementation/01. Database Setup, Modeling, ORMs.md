# Models and Seeding with FastAPI SQLAlchemy

[SQLAlchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/) is an object-relational-mapper (ORM) for Python to programmatically access a SQL database. An ORM's job is to 'map' or transform between SQL records, and Python objects. Here's an illustration:

![](./images/database-1.png)

SQLAlchemy allows us to create database entries without needing to write the actual SQL statements. SQLAlchemy will do that for us.

### The Plan

1. We're going to be building models to represent our Tea data using SQLAlchemy.

2. We're then going to be writing a small Python script, called `seed.py`, that will add initial data into our PostgreSQL Database, using our models.

## Installation

SQLAlchemy is a 3rd-party library which is in no way related to FastAPI. However, it's widely used with FastAPI applications due to its powerful and flexible database toolkit.

Because we'll be using PostgreSQL as our database engine, we also need to install a PostgreSQL adapter for Python called `psycopg2-binary`

Make sure you're in the `./exercises/fast_api_crud_app` directory. 
This file is a copy of the `fast_api_crud_app_solution` from Day-02 so we begin the process of refactoring that code to continue building out our API by adding our database.

Install in the virtual environment using `pipenv`:

```sh
pipenv install sqlalchemy psycopg2-binary
```

We can now hook it up to our FastAPI app.

## Connecting our app to a database

First, we need to setup the database connection in a separate file in the models folder called `./models/database.py`. Create this file in your editor and add the following:

```py
# database.py

from sqlalchemy import create_engine
from sqlalchemy.orm import sessionmaker
from config.environment import db_URI

# ! Connect FastAPI with SQLAlchemy
engine = create_engine(db_URI)
SessionLocal = sessionmaker(autocommit=False, autoflush=False, bind=engine)

def get_db():
    db = SessionLocal()
    try:
        yield db
    finally:
        db.close()
```

Here we're doing a few things:
* We first import necessary libraries from SQLAlchemy (`create_engine` and `sessionmaker`).
* Then, we create an engine and a `SessionLocal` class with `create_engine` and `sessionmaker`. The `SessionLocal` class is our actual database session.
* By the way, the autocommit and autoflush parameters are set to `False` by default. This is because we want to control when we commit changes to the database. We'll do this manually in our API.
* The `get_db` function is a dependency that can be included in the path operation functions. This function creates a new session and closes it once the request is finished.
* The yield keyword is used to create a generator function. This allows us to use the function as a context manager, which means that the session will be closed automatically when the request is finished.

Now let's create the directory `config`:

```sh
mkdir config
```
Create `config/environment.py` and populate it as follows:

**config/environment.py**
```py
# config/environment.py
db_URI = "postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/teas_db"
```

This connection string will ultimately connect to the local PostgreSQL `teas_db` database on your virtual machine.

## Usage

Now that SQLAlchemy has been installed, we need to create a model, which will define the structure of the database table that will store the data for our resource. For this example, we will use **teas** as our resource.

### Defining some models

To define a model, we will create a class in `models/tea.py` which extends SQLAlchemy's `Base` class:

```py
# models/tea.py

from sqlalchemy import Column, Integer, String, Boolean
from sqlalchemy.ext.declarative import declarative_base

Base = declarative_base()

# ! TeaModel extends SQLAlchemy's Base class.
# ! Extending Base lets SQLAlchemy 'know' about our model, so it can use it.

class TeaModel(Base):

    # ! This will be used directly to make a
    # ! TABLE in Postgresql
    __tablename__ = "teas"

    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True)

    # ! Specific columns for our Tea Table.
    name = Column(String, unique=True)
    in_stock = Column(Boolean)
    rating = Column(Integer)
```

The _magic_ property `__tablename__` is used to name our table.

We define the table structure using the `Column` class, and various data types, which include:

-   `Integer`
-   `Float`
-   `String`
-   `Text`
-   `Enums`
-   `Boolean`
-   `Date`
-   `Time`
-   `DateTime`

## Creating a seed program

Now we're going to write a small Python script, `seed.py`. The sole responsibility of this script is to generate our tables and put some initial testing data in our database. This will allow to make sure everything is working in terms of our models, _before_ we make any changes to our API itself.

Create `seed.py` and add this program for seeding:

```py
# seed.py
from sqlalchemy.orm import sessionmaker
from models.tea import Base
from data.tea_data import teas_list
from config.environment import db_URI
from sqlalchemy import create_engine

engine = create_engine(db_URI)
SessionLocal = sessionmaker(bind=engine)

# ! This seed file is a separate program that can be used to "seed" our database with some initial data.
try:
    print("Recreating database..")
    # ! Dropping (or deleting) the tables and creating them again is for convenience. Once we start to play around with
    # ! our data, changing our models, this seed program will allow us to rapidly throw out the old data and replace it.
    Base.metadata.drop_all(bind=engine)
    Base.metadata.create_all(bind=engine)

    print("seeding our database..")
    # ! Seed teas
    db = SessionLocal()
    db.add_all(teas_list)
    db.commit()
    db.close()

    print("bye ðŸ‘‹")
except Exception as e:
    print(e)

```

Our seed data will come from a new file named `data/tea_data.py`. We'll repurpose our previously created `tea_data.py` file for this. Let's also create a dedicated directory for it:

```sh
mkdir data
```

Now move the existing `models/tea_data.py` to `data`:

```sh
mv models/tea_data.py data`
```

Overwrite `data/tea_data.py`, and add the following:

```py
# data/tea_data.py
from models.tea import TeaModel

# ! We create some instances of our tea model here, which will be used in seeding.
teas_list = [
    TeaModel(name="chai", rating=4, in_stock=True),
    TeaModel(name="earl grey", rating=3, in_stock=False)
]
```

The above is the code that will actually create instances of our SQLAlchemy models, to be used by our seeding program. It makes those lists of models, ready for us to commit to the database in `seed.py`.

We can see where this is used in our `seed.py` here:

```py
# Seed teas
db.add_all(teas_list)
db.commit()
```

The `db` (a SQLAlchemy session instance) collates all the database interactions. 

When `commit()` is called, SQLAlchemy generates the appropriate SQL statements to update the database.

## Resetting PostgreSQL Password

This guide demonstrates how to reset the PostgreSQL `postgres` user password using the command line.

## Procedure

1. **Stop PostgreSQL Service**

bash
```
sudo systemctl stop postgresql
```
2. **Start PostgreSQL in Single-User Mode**
```
sudo -u postgres postgres --single -D /var/lib/pgsql/data
```
3. **Change Password Inside PostgreSQL Prompt**

Once inside the PostgreSQL single-user mode prompt, type the following command:
```
ALTER USER postgres WITH PASSWORD 'postgres';
```

Crt+D to get into a new cli line to restart the service 

4. **Start PostgreSQL Service by typing**

```
sudo systemctl start postgresql
```

5. **Verify the Password Change**

```
psql -U postgres
```

When prompted for a password, enter `postgres`.

6. **Exit the PostgreSQL Prompt**

```
\q
```


## Creating the database

You will need to ensure that you have created a database before you attempt to seed it. Our seed program will create the *table* but not the database itself. The database name should match the `db_URI` variable in `environment.py`, which is `teas_db`:

```sh
createdb teas_db -U postgres
```

When prompted for a password, enter `postgres`.

Note: The `createdb` command is a utility command provided by PostgreSQL and may not be available if users are using different types of SQL databases.

To check that the database was created, we can check it using `psql`:

```sh
psql teas_db -U postgres
```

Type `\q` and hit enter to exit the `psql` shell.

## Seeding the database

We should now be able to seed the database with the following commands:

```sh
pipenv run python seed.py
```

### Troubleshooting Postgres
If you get an error `Ident authentication failed for user "postgres"`, please let an IA know. Please do *not* follow these troubleshooting steps unless you receive that specific error. You will need to modify the file `/var/lib/pgsql/data/pg_hba.conf`.

Run this command to open the file in the `vim` editor:

```
sudo vim /var/lib/pgsql/data/pg_hba.conf
```

Locate this line:

```host    all             all             127.0.0.1/32            ident```

And change it to this:

```host    all             all             127.0.0.1/32            md5```

Use `:wq` command to exit vim  

Then restart PostgreSQL:

```
sudo systemctl restart postgresql
```

You should now be able to run `pipenv run python seed.py`

### Verifying the data

Once seeding has completed, re-connect to the `psql` shell: `psql -d teas_db -U postgres`

In the psql shell, run the following query:

```sql
SELECT * FROM teas;
```

You should see something like the following:

```
 id |   name    | in_stock | rating 
----+-----------+----------+--------
  1 | chai      | t        |      4
  2 | earl grey | f        |      3
```

Well done! Remember, our API still does not use our database. We have a database and have seeded it with data, but we still need to link this up to our API. We'll do this in the next session.
