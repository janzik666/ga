# Serialization

Serialization is the process of converting complex data types, such as objects, into a format that can be easily stored or transmitted and then reconstructed later. In the context of a FastAPI application, you'll commonly need to convert SQLAlchemy models into JSON for transmission over HTTP, a process also known as _serialization_. The reverse process is known as _deserialization_, which involves converting received data back into Python objects.

To perform these serialization and deserialization operations, we'll use FastAPI's integrated [Pydantic](https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/) library. Let's walk through how you can serialize your SQLAlchemy models using Pydantic.

## Pydantic Models

Like SQLAlchemy, Pydantic provides a way to define models which can be used to simplify the serialization process. 

Make sure you're still in your `./exercises/fastapi_crud_app/` directory.

Install Pydantic:

```sh
pipenv install pydantic
```

Create a `serializers` directory.

```sh
mkdir serializers
```

Define a Pydantic model for the `Tea` model in `serializers/tea.py`:

**serializers/tea.py**
```py
# serializers/tea.py
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field
from typing import Optional, List
from .comment import CommentSchema

class TeaSchema(BaseModel):
  id: Optional[int] = Field(None) # This makes sure you don't have to explicitly add an id when sending json data
  name: str
  in_stock: bool
  rating: int
  comments: List[CommentSchema] = []

  class Config:
    orm_mode = True
```

You can also nest Pydantic models to include related data, such as comments for a tea. Next, define the `CommentSchema`:

**serializers/comment.py**
```py
# serializers/comment.py
from pydantic import BaseModel

class CommentSchema(BaseModel):
  id: int
  content: str

  class Config:
    orm_mode = True
```

You can now use these Pydantic models to serialize the SQLAlchemy models for transmission over HTTP.

Next up, we'll need to update our teas controller to return the serialized data from our database.
